# TODO

- upgrade to glimmer 2.6.0
- support path shapes

## Maybe

- Consider always setting a VBOX as the default child of `window` if no `Region` child is specified
- Add keyword aliases like `vbox` for `v_box`
- Support nested windows
- Handle any crashes gracefully, keeping app alive regardless just like Glimmer DSL for SWT does it
